# Baseline Capture: Zero-Intervention Prompt Runs (3072D MLP Vectors)

## 🎯 Objective

Establish a baseline reference set of activation vectors in GPT-2 Small (Layer 11, MLP output space) by running the same prompts used in the Neuron 373 intervention experiments — but with no neuron clamping or activation modification.

This baseline will allow comparison with prior intervention-based SRM sweeps and help identify whether directional drift observed in those runs is a genuine effect of Neuron 373 manipulation, or a natural bias in prompt dynamics.

## 🧪 Input Files

- `promptsv3.txt`
- `promptsv4.txt`

---

## 🛠️ Script Functionality

A new variant of the previous sweep script should be created, e.g., `neuron_batch_mlp_post_capture_baseline.py`.

**It will:**
1. Load each prompt from the `.txt` file
2. Run the model *without any neuron intervention* (no `run_with_hooks`)
3. Generate a completion of 50 tokens
4. Capture the full `[tokens, 3072]` activation matrix at `hook_mlp_post` for Layer 11
5. Average over the token dimension → shape: `[3072]` per prompt
6. Save to a `.npz` file with same format as previous runs:
   - Example: `results_v3_no_intervention_mean_vectors_3072d.npz`

---

## ⚙️ Parameters

- Generation length: 50 tokens
- Use same model, tokenizer, and pipeline structure as prior experiments
- Output log and `.md` file optional but useful for consistency

---

## 📦 Expected Output

Two `.npz` files:
- `results_v3_no_intervention_mean_vectors_3072d.npz`
- `results_v4_no_intervention_mean_vectors_3072d.npz`

Each should contain:
- One `[3072]` vector per prompt
- Stored under the prompt key

---

## 🔍 Follow-Up Use

These vectors will be swept through the same SRM 373+2202 spotlight plane to produce a **baseline resonance profile**.

It will be directly compared against:
- `results_v3_len50_mean_vectors_3072d.npz`
- `results_v4_len50_mean_vectors_3072d.npz`

---

## ✨ Importance

This is a crucial control to determine whether the resonance and directional drift observed during the Neuron 373 interventions are truly caused by those interventions — or if similar drift exists under unmodified conditions.
